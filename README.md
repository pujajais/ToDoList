The user can set the priority of the TODO as well.
Kanban (看板), which is literally translated from Japanese as sign board or billboard, is methodology for managing work. You can learn about the Kanban methodology via Wikipedia, or a handful of other resources on the Web.

In this assignment you are to create a simple Kanban board to manage your work. You can view an example here.

NOTE: Your board does not need to look like my example. You do not need to use Bootstrap, nor do you need to use icons. Using simple hyperlinks is sufficient.

Your board will consist of 3 columns: To-Do, In-Progress, and Done.

Each column will consist of zero (0) or more cards. A card is a visual representation of a task that needs to be done. A card consists of both, a title and a description.

When using a Kanban board, you put all of your work that has to be done in the first column named To-Do.

All cards in your first column should be ordered based on importance. In other words, the Card that you should work on next should appear at the top of the list, and the least important should appear at the bottom of the list.

When you are ready to begin work on the next card you would move it to the In-Progress column.

There is only a finite amount of work that you can have in-progress at any given time, so you will want to limit the amount of work that is in-progress.

Again, the work in the in-progress column should be prioritized with the most important work appearing at the top of the list, and the least important appearing at the bottom.

Once a Card has been completed, you would move it to the Done column to illustrate it's completeness.
